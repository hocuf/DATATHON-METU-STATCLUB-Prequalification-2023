# DATATHON METU STATCLUB Prequalification 2023


In this datathon project you will be given an 18-month transaction dataset. You will start by dividing this dataset into 2 separate 9-month periods. You will create a churn model using the first 9-month period.

In the second step, you will create a churn variable. The first 9-month period will be used for this process. For example, users who were active in the first 6-month period will be identified and it will be determined whether these users churned in the last 3-month period. If there is a response imbalance, this problem should be solved before model creation.

Finally, using what you have learnt from the first 9-month period, you will use your churn model to predict whether the active customers in the dataset in the second 9-month period (for example, those active in the first 6 months of the second dataset) will churn in the last 3 months.

This project focuses on analysing the transaction dataset and predicting the probability of customer churn. Steps such as processing this data, building a model and interpreting the results are necessary to analyse the data.
